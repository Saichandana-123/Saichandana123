Tic-Tac-Toe Game
Project Overview
This is a simple console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game  in C. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid,
aiming to get three of their symbols (either 'X' or 'O') in a row, column, or diagonal. 
The game ends when either a player wins or the board is full, resulting in a tie.

Execution Instructions
Compile the Code:

Ensure you have a C compiler installed on your system (e.g., GCC).
Open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory containing the source code (tic_tac_toe.c).
Run the following command to compile the code:
Copy code
gcc tic_tac_toe.c -o tic_tac_toe
Run the Game:

After successful compilation, run the executable file:
bash
Copy code
./tic_tac_toe
Playing the Game:

Follow the prompts on the console to enter your moves.
Players take turns entering the box number (1-9) where they want to place their symbol ('X' or 'O').
The game will display the updated board after each move.
The game ends when either a player wins or the board is full.
Game Outcome:

If a player wins, the game will display the winning player.
If the game ends in a tie, it will display "Game Over! It's a tie."
Restarting the Game:

To play again, simply run the executable file (./tic_tac_toe) again.
